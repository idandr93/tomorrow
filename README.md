Superwise.ai home assignment.

created two folders, server and client.
for running the project, please enter each folder:
cd server
npm i
npm run dev

also for the client:
cd client
npm i
npm start

server handle a GET request and the client shows data, 
in the client you can also enter the dates in the given format YYYY-mm-dd
and that will filter the data

Thank you, Idan
